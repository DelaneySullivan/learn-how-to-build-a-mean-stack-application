# Angular Tutorial: Learn Angular from scratch step by step REST API

This project is a Loopback API used in part 2 of [Learn Angular from scratch step by step tutorial](https://angular-templates.io/tutorials/about/learn-angular-from-scratch-step-by-step) where we explore from the basic concepts and why‚Äôs of Angular to building a complete Angular 7 app with the MEAN stack.

The goal of this angular 7 tutorial is to guide you through the coding of a full-stack JavaScript example application project and connecting a backend API to an Angular front-end application employing the MEAN stack.

By the end of this Angular advanced tutorial, you will learn about the mean stack from scratch, including how to build a RESTful API with Loopback and using it to perform CRUD operations on a MongoDB database through an Angular frontend.

## Installation

Run `npm install` to install all the required dependencies

Then run `npm run start` to start the API in your local environment.

Web server listening at: http://localhost:3000

Browse your REST API at http://localhost:3000/explorer

CS 470 Final Reflection
https://youtu.be/TEZIAFt8qYs

CS 470 has helped me become a more marketable candidate in my career field because it has helped me develop a strong understanding of how to build a MEAN stack application. As a software developer I‚Äôve gained strengths such as implementing security, building databases, and developing API‚Äôs. In this new job, the types of roles I‚Äôd assume would include web developer, web designer, software engineer, and API specialist. Learning the skills mentioned above will help me be successful in these roles! 
The way I‚Äôd handle scale and error handling in an application would be first to build the applications architecture in a way that handles better error reporting. This would include naming conventions that align with related systems, that way anyone working on the system can easily understand where the error is coming from. I‚Äôd then include the version information that way it‚Äôs clear across all platforms. Furthermore, the way I‚Äôd predict costs of the application first by the scale of the application. If the actual architecture of the application is larger than normal, then I‚Äôd make the most higher than a small scale application. I‚Äôd also include the serverless costs, which is the pay-as-you-go feature. For the most cost predictable option, serverless is the way to go over containers because it helps prevent unnecessary expenses of resources. Containers are constantly running and can cost users more to use. 
Explain several pros and cons that would be deciding factors in plans for expansion
If I were to expand my software application, some pros would include reaching more customers, increasing our resources and stock, and that you have full control over the expansion. Some cons include that it will cost money to make money and the time it‚Äôll take to develop the expansion. Lastly, elasticity plays a role in decision making for planned future growth because it helps indicate how much resources that need to be used, which also plays a role in pricing. For pay-for-service, it allows flexibility in expansion. This way you don‚Äôt have to overpay or overload costs when trying to expand.
